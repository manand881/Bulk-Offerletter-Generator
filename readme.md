# Bulk Offer Letter Generator

This repository hosts a two programs named  `OfferLetterMakerSolera.exe` and `OfferLetterMakerLokSamvad.exe` which create offer letters for Solera Life and Lok Samwad Respectively

## Usage

* Ensure that you have `MS Word` installed in your computer.
* Contact me to recieve the template file and place it in the correct folders. without this the program will not work
* Navigate to the folder which is named after the organization for which you want to create an offer letter for.
* Open `offers.csv` in notepad or any other IDE of your choice. I would not recomment opening it in `Excel`
* Populate the details of the internship letter, such as `Name`, `Position`,  `Date of Joining`, `Term` in the `Offers.csv` file. While filling, make sure you leave a line after the header and populate the details as shown below. It should look like this. 
```csv
Name[Ex:Jhon Doe],Position[Ex:Software Tester],Date[Ex:dd-mm-yyyy],Term

Anand,Python Developer,12-01-2021,6
Jhon Doe,Front End Developer,13-01-2021,5
```
* Please note that you must follow the syntax and use `-` and `,` as puntuations only. no other symbols are allowed
* While fillin in the details please ensure that you are making note of punctuation such as capitals letters respectively.

* Run the `.exe` file to generate the Offer Letter. A `.pdf` will be created for each applicant
